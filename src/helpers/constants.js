    A typical hardwood tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year.
    
    Performance is scored according to energy baseline.`,

    PEAK_RATIO: `Represents the disparity between peak and average power within a facility.

    To optimize efficiency, the goal is to close the gap between both metrics.

    The aim is to score as close to 1 as possible.`,

    BASE_ENERGY: `This is an algorithm that forecasts energy consumption by benchmarking energy use, weather and number of days to set a baseline usage.

    Baseline usage is compared to actual consumption to score energy performance.`,

    SIZE_EFFICIENCY: `Generator Size Efficiency: This info-graph measures and scores the efficiency or inefficiency of the generator’s size in comparison to power demanded by the facility. `,

    FUEL_EFFICIENCYL: `Fuel Efficiency: This is an average kWh/liter ratio derived from real data of diesel consumed in a facility.
    
    The ratio is benchmarked against the ideal consumption of a well maintained and sized diesel generator.`,

    OPERATING_TIME: `Operating Time: Reports each event and duration generators are operated outside official hours, the diesel consumed and cost in Naira.`
